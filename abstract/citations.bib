abstract = {Android rooting enables device owners to freely customize their own devices and run useful apps that require root privi-leges. While useful, rooting weakens the security of Android devices and opens the door for malware to obtain privileged access easily. Thus, several rooting prevention mechanisms have been introduced by vendors, and sensitive or high-value mobile apps perform rooting detection to mitigate potential security exposures on rooted devices. However, there is a lack of understanding whether existing rooting prevention and detection methods are effective. To fill this knowledge gap, we studied existing Android rooting methods and per-formed manual and dynamic analysis on 182 selected apps, in order to identify current rooting detection methods and evaluate their effectiveness. Our results suggest that these methods are ineffective. We conclude that reliable meth-ods for detecting rooting must come from integrity-protected kernels or trusted execution environments, which are diffi-cult to bypass.},
