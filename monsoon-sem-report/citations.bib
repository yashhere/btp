abstract = {This chapter will first briefly introduce Android's architecture, inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, and main components. We then describe Android's security model and how it relates to the underlying Linux security infrastructure and code signing. We conclude with a brief overview of some newer additions to Android's security model, namely multi-user support, mandatory access control (MAC) based on SELinux, and verified boot. Android's architecture and security model are built on top of the tra-ditional Unix process, user, and file paradigm, but this paradigm is not described from scratch here. We assume a basic familiarity with Unix-like systems, particularly Linux. android's architecture Let's briefly examine Android's architecture from the bottom up. Figure 1-1 shows a simplified representation of the Android stack.},
