\chapter{Future Work}

We plan to use Drozer, a security testing framework for Android; to test the Android security model and some of the publicly available exploits. We also plan to contribute any possible improvements to the codebase of Drozer and implement some Drozer modules to implement and test what we have studied in this semester.
